/*.....The Problem...........
You borrowed $5000 for 2 years with 2% interest per year. Calculate the simple interest to know how much you have to pay?
.........Hint.........
Just take amount, duration and interest rate.
You have to multiply these three. And, donâ€™t forget: you have to convert percent to a fraction by dividing it by 100.*/
